# Worklog 0000006: Continual Learning Setup

## Summary

Set up the continual-learning infrastructure for this workspace.

## Changes Made

1. Created `AGENTS.md` with initial workspace facts extracted from `.cursorrules`
2. Created `.cursor/hooks/state/continual-learning-index.json` to track processed transcripts
3. Processed 1 transcript (current session) - no user preferences to extract yet

## Notes

- Only one transcript exists currently (this session)
- Future sessions will incrementally extract preferences and facts
- AGENTS.md will grow as more transcripts accumulate with user corrections/preferences
